## Hero Widget in Flutter
The *Hero widget* in Flutter is used to create a seamless transition between two screens. It enables a shared element animation, allowing an image or widget to animate smoothly from one screen to another. By using the same Hero tag in two different widgets, Flutter automatically handles the transition animation. This provides a visually appealing user experience when navigating between pages.
